***Time to dive into Object Oriented Programming!***

### Project summary
> 4th ring Codam project

This project is seperated in 9 modules wich all introduce different topics of C++. The following modules are included -
- <a href="https://github.com/rbakker96/CPP/tree/master/D00">Module 00</a> : Namespace, class, member functions, stdio stream, initialization lists, static, const, and lots of basic stuf
- <a href="https://github.com/rbakker96/CPP/tree/master/D01">Module 01</a> : Memory allocation, References, Pointers to members, File streams
- <a href="https://github.com/rbakker96/CPP/tree/master/D02">Module 02</a> : Ad-hoc polymorphism, operators overload and canonical classes
- <a href="https://github.com/rbakker96/CPP/tree/master/D03">Module 03</a> : Inheritance
- <a href="https://github.com/rbakker96/CPP/tree/master/D04">Module 04</a> : Subtype polymorphism, abstract classes, interfaces
- <a href="https://github.com/rbakker96/CPP/tree/master/D05">Module 05</a> : Repetition and Exceptions
- <a href="https://github.com/rbakker96/CPP/tree/master/D06">Module 06</a> : C++ Casts
- <a href="https://github.com/rbakker96/CPP/tree/master/D07">Module 07</a> : c++ Templates
- <a href="https://github.com/rbakker96/CPP/tree/master/D08">Module 08</a> : Templated containers, iterators, algorithms

### Technical considerations
> The project needs to comply with the following rules/functionalities.

- Any function implemented in a header (except in the case of templates), and any unprotected header, means 0 to the exercise.
- Every output goes to the standard output, and will be ended by a newline, unless specified otherwise.
- he imposed filenames must be followed to the letter, as well as class names, function names and method names.
- Remember: You are coding in C++ now, not in C anymore. Therefore:
  - The following functions are FORBIDDEN, and their use will be punished by a 0, no questions asked: *alloc, *printf and free.
  - You are allowed to use basically everything in the standard library. HOWEVER, it would be smart to try and use the C++-ish versions of the functions you are used to in C, instead of just keeping to what you know, this is a new language after all. And NO, you are not allowed to use the STL until you actually are supposed to (that is, until module 08). That means no vectors/lists/maps/etc... or anything that requires an include <algorithm> until then.
- Actually, the use of any explicitly forbidden function or mechanic will be punished by a 0, no questions asked.
- Also note that unless otherwise stated, the C++ keywords "using namespace" and "friend" are forbidden. Their use will be punished by a -42, no questions asked.
- Files associated with a class will always be ClassName.hpp and ClassName.cpp, unless specified otherwise.
- Turn-in directories are ex00/, ex01/, . . . , exn/.
- You must read the examples thoroughly. They can contain requirements that are not obvious in the exercise’s description. If something seems ambiguous, you don’t understand C++ enough.
- Since you are allowed to use the C++ tools you learned about since the beginning you are not allowed to use any external library. And before you ask, that also means no C++11 and derivates, nor Boost or anything your awesomely skilled friend told you C++ can’t exist without.
- You may be required to turn in an important number of classes. This can seem tedious, unless you’re able to script your favorite text editor.
- Read each exercise FULLY before starting it! Really, do it.
- The compiler to use is clang++.
- Your code has to be compiled with the following flags : -Wall -Wextra -Werror.
- Each of your includes must be able to be included independently from others. Includes must contains every other includes they are depending on, obviously.
- In case you’re wondering, no coding style is enforced during in C++. You can use any style you like, no restrictions. But remember that a code your peer-evaluator can’t read is a code she or he can’t grade.
- Important stuff now : You will NOT be graded by a program, unless explictly stated in the subject. Therefore, you are afforded a certain amount of freedom in how you choose to do the exercises. However, be mindful of the constraints of each exercise, and DO NOT be lazy, you would miss a LOT of what they have to offer !
- It’s not a problem to have some extraneous files in what you turn in, you may choose to separate your code in more files than what’s asked of you. Feel free, as long as the result is not graded by a program.
- Even if the subject of an exercise is short, it’s worth spending some time on it to be absolutely sure you understand what’s expected of you, and that you did it in the best possible way.
